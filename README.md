# NetworkDecisions
The code provided here was used to produce the figures in the paper "Optimal Evidence Accumulation on Networks"

The name of the file corresponds to the figure in the paper that was produced by the file.  Running the code will produce the figures.  All simulations here were done in MATLAB

fig34-1.m
This file produces evidence accumulation trajectories for a two-agent unidirectional network.  The script was used to produce both figures 3.1 and 4.1 in the paper.

fig5-1.m
This file produces evidence accumulation trajectories for a recurrent two-agent network.  Equilibration is necessary for proper transfer of decision information.
